# Summary

I am a freelance Senior Perl Developer with over 26 years' experience,
including exposure to web scraping, data wrangling, Git, MySQL,
NGINX, Apache HTTP Server, Python, XSLT, XML, RelaxNG, HTML, and CSS.

I'm an active proponent of Modern Perl. I like writing technical
documentation and unit tests; both have saved my customers and I a
lot of time over the years. I prefer to reuse tested code as much as
possible, hence I often start a project with researching available
solutions on CPAN.

# Experience as Senior Perl Developer

## Peppels.net

**January 2019 - present**; remote, part-time

 - Maintenance of existing code base; Perl, JavaScript, Template
   Toolkit, HTML and CSS3.

 - Testing and adjusting mobile design.

## SF Metrics

**August 2015 - present**; remote, part-time

 - Developed a program to import a "JSON per line" database dump into
   a MySQL database. I reverse engineered the file format, designed
   the 70+ MySQL database tables, and added logic to avoid duplicate
   code.
 - Developed a web crawler that downloads XML data, verifies this
   data, gathers some statistics, and stores desired data and
   statistics in a MySQL database. I am also reponsible for writing
   all the technical documentation, specifications, and example SQL
   queries. (ongoing)
 - Developed several tools for analyzing search engine result pages
   (SERPs) (ongoing)
 - Porting Perl programs to the Go programming language. (ongoing)
 - Developed Perl modules for storing data in Amazon's S3.

## RedSocks - Malicious Threat Detection

**February 2013 - December 2015**; remote, part-time

 - Developed several web crawling Perl programs for gathering security
   related data, each crawler exporting downloaded data as a CSV file.
 - Developed a Perl program that downloads security related data
   from several sources, verifies, cleans, normalizes the data, and
   export it as an XML file.
 - Developed a Perl program that post-processes the exported XML data
   to remove duplicate entries and overlapping IP ranges using a
   binary search algorithm.
 - Developed a Perl program that parses log files (Log4Perl) generated
   by aforementioned programs, creates reports, and emails those
   reports.
 - Developed a Dancer2 web application to manually enter IP ranges and
   related security data and store this information into a MySQL
   database.
 - Configured virtual machines for each of the Perl programs,
   including designing firewall rules, and allowing access via `rsync`
   and HTTPS in a secure manner where required. Documented the entire
   process of configuration and installation in great detail.
 - Wrote documentation on how to create certificates to allow client
   side certificate authentication in NGINX (HTTPS), and configuring
   NGINX accordingly.
 - Wrote extensive tests for all developed custom Perl modules and
   scripts.
 - Designed file formats (XML, CSV). Documented each format in Org
   Mode format (Emacs).
 - Designed Relax NG schemata to validate XML files.
 - Wrote XSLT to transform XML output to older formats in order to
   support client programs that require an older format prior to being
   safely updated.
 - Wrote extensive technical documentation in Org Mode format (Emacs).
