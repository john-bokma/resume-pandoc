# Summary

I'm a Senior Software Engineer focused on full stack web development all around TypeScript.

I like focusing on developer experience and shared solutions to enable other developers, leveraging shared libraries, systems like CI/CD or creating first party tooling within the company.

When it comes to building features for end users, I enjoy taking end to end ownership, including both the backend and actual user interface.

Providing technical leadership is a role I flourish in, be it organizing initiatives such as software guilds, adopting new technologies or defining architectures for entire systems.
